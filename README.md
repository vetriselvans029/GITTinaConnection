This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and configured for Open Authoring with TinaCMS. This repo follows the steps outlined in [this guide](https://tinacms.org/guides/nextjs/github-open-authoring/initial-setup).

## Edit with Open Authoring

Head to [the demo](https://tina-open-auth.now.sh/) and hit the 'Edit this Page' button in the top left-hand corner. You will be prompted to authenticate with GitHub and create a fork. After that, you'll be in ['Preview Mode'](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/preview-mode) and can edit the title via the Tina Sidebar. When you save, that content will be committed to your fork.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
